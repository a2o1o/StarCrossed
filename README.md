# üöÄ PairMorph - Mars Colony Reproduction Simulator

**AI-driven simulation tool that models how a small human colony could sustain healthy, genetically diverse reproduction under Martian conditions.**

## üåç Overview

PairMorph creates *synthetic physiological and psychological data* for simulated crew members, applies *evolutionary pairing algorithms* to optimize genetic diversity and minimize fertility/radiation risk, and visualizes the *multi-generation outcomes* (family trees, mutation risk, diversity index).

It's designed to look scientifically credible ‚Äî not a game, but a research-inspired simulation tool (think: "NASA policy sandbox meets ethical AI").

## üß† System Architecture

- **`data.py`** ‚Üí Generates *realistic physiological data* based on NASA-style distributions (age, radiation tolerance, VO‚ÇÇ max, fertility index, immune resilience)
- **`simulation.py`** ‚Üí Computes compatibility, radiation exposure decay, mutation risk, and pairing optimization (genetic algorithms)
- **`visualization.py`** ‚Üí Interactive visualizations (Plotly) of compatibility, fertility trends, diversity evolution
